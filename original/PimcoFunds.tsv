"* The since inception date for the PIMCO California Municipal Intermediate Value Fund, PIMCO California Municipal Opportunistic Value Fund, PIMCO National Municipal Intermediate Value Fund, PIMCO National Municipal Opportunistic Value Fund, PIMCO RAE Emerging Markets Fund, PIMCO RAE US Fund and PIMCO RAE US Small Fund is the performance inception date. Performance presented prior to 18 March 2019 and 5 June 2015 represents the historical track record of the predecessor fund and sub-adviser for the PIMCO Gurtin and PIMCO RAE Funds, respectively, and should not be interpreted as the actual historical performance of PIMCO.

**The SEC Yield data represents the 30-Day SEC yield except for the PIMCO Government Money Market Fund which represents the 7-Day SEC Yield. The 30-Day SEC yield is an annualized yield based on the most recent 30 day period. The 7-Day SEC yield is an annualized yield based on the most recent 7 day period. The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the fund than the total return quotation. The Subsidized yield includes contractual expense reimbursements and it would be lower without those reimbursements. The Unsubsidized 30 Day SEC yield excludes contractual expense reimbursements.

"Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. This and other information are contained in the Fund’s prospectus, which may be obtained by contacting your PIMCO representative. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money."																		
																		
																		
"Performance quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. Investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate. Shares may be worth more or less than original cost when redeemed. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance shown. For performance current to the most recent month-end, visit www.pimco.com or call (888) 87-PIMCO for PIMCO Funds. For mutual fund Class A shares the maximum offering price (MOP) returns take into account the maximum initial sales charge.

This charge may apply to shares redeemed during the first year of ownership."

"The performance figures presented reflect the total return performance, unless otherwise noted, and reflect changes in share price, reinvestment of dividends, and capital gain distributions. NAV returns reflect the deduction of management fees and expenses. NAV and Market Price returns do not reflect broker sales charges or commissions and would be lower if they were deducted. All periods longer than one year are annualized. Periods less than one year are cumulative. "																		
																		
"Investments made by a Fund and the results achieved by a Fund are not expected to be the same as those made by any other PIMCO-advised Fund, including those with a similar name, investment objective or policies. A new or smaller Fund’s performance may not represent how the Fund is expected to or may perform in the long-term. New Funds have limited operating histories for investors to evaluate and new and smaller Funds may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies. A Fund may be forced to sell a comparatively large portion of its portfolio to meet significant shareholder redemptions for cash, or hold a comparatively large portion of its portfolio in cash due to significant share purchases for cash, in each case when the Fund otherwise would not seek to do so, which may adversely affect performance."																		
																		
																		
																		
"Differences in the Fund’s performance versus the index and related attribution information with respect to particular categories of securities or individual positions may be attributable, in part, to differences in the pricing methodologies used by the Fund and the index."																		
																		
																		
																		
"It is important to note that differences exist between the fund’s daily internal accounting records, the fund’s financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and recordkeeping practices under income tax regulations. It is possible that the fund may not issue a Section 19 Notice in situations where the fund’s financial statements prepared later and in accordance with U.S. GAAP and/or the final tax character of those distributions might later report that the sources of those distributions included capital gains and/or a return of capital. Please see the fund’s most recent shareholder report for more details."																		
																		
																		
																		
"Although select Funds may seek to maintain stable distributions, the Funds’ distribution rates may be affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to changes in realized and projected market returns, fluctuations in market interest rates, Fund performance, and other factors. There can be no assurance that a change in market conditions or other factors will not result in a change in a Fund’s distribution rate or that the rate will be sustainable in the future."																		
																		
																		
																		
"For instance, during periods of low or declining interest rates, the Fund’s distributable income and dividend levels may decline for many reasons. For example, the Fund may have to deploy uninvested assets (whether from purchases of Fund shares, proceeds from matured, traded or called debt obligations or other sources) in new, lower yielding instruments. Additionally, payments from certain instruments that may be held by the Fund (such as variable and floating rate securities) may be negatively impacted by declining interest rates, which may also lead to a decline in the Fund’s distributable income and dividend levels."																		
																		
																		
																		
"PIMCO California Municipal Intermediate Value Fund and PIMCO National Municipal Intermediate Value Fund were funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and managed by Gurtin (the “Predecessor Funds”) that was reorganized into the Funds effective March 15, 2019. The Predecessor Funds had investment objectives and strategies that were, in all materials respects, the same as those of the Funds. The Funds’ performance for periods prior to the commencement of operations on March 18, 2019 is that of the Predecessor Funds. The performance of the Predecessor Funds has not been restated to reflect the fees, estimated expenses and fee waivers and/or expense limitations applicable to the Funds. If restated, the performance may have been higher or lower than the performance shown. The performance of each class of shares of the Funds will differ as a result of the different levels of fees and expenses applicable to each class of shares."																		
																		
																		
																		
"PIMCO California Municipal Opportunistic Value Fund and PIMCO National Municipal Opportunistic Value Fund were privately offered funds managed by Gurtin (the “Private Predecessor Funds”) that was reorganized into funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) that were also managed by Gurtin (the “Registered Predecessor Funds,” together with the Private Predecessor Funds, the “Predecessor Funds”) on or about November 3, 2014. The Private Predecessor Funds were organized on November 16, 2009 and commenced operations on May 3, 2010 and had investment objectives and strategies that were, in all material respects, identical to those of the Registered Predecessor Funds, and were managed by Gurtin in a manner that, in all material respects, complied with the investment guidelines and restrictions of the Registered Predecessor Funds. However, the Private Predecessor Funds were not registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act, and the Private Predecessor Funds were not subject to certain investment limitations, diversification requirements, liquidity requirements, and other restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which, if applicable, may have adversely affected their performance. The Registered Predecessor Funds commenced operations on or about November 3, 2014 and had investment objectives and strategies that were, in all material respects, identical to those of the Funds, and were managed by Gurtin in a manner that, in all material respects, complied with the investment guidelines and restrictions of the Funds. The Funds’ performance for periods prior to the commencement of operations on March 18, 2019 is that of the Predecessor Funds. The Funds’ performance for the period from May 3, 2010 to November 2, 2014 is that of the Private Predecessor Funds. The Fund’s performance for the period from November 3, 2014 to March 15, 2019 is that of the Registered Predecessor Funds. The performance of the Private Predecessor Funds were calculated net of the Private Predecessor Funds’ fees and expenses.

"PIMCO RAE Emerging Markets Fund, PIMCO RAE US Fund and PIMCO RAE US Small Fund were privately offered funds managed by the Fund’s Sub-Adviser and were reorganized into the Funds as of 5 June 2015. For periods prior to the commencement of Funds’ operations, the Funds’ performance is that of the privately offered funds. The performance of the privately offered funds has not been restated to reflect the fees, estimated expenses and fee waivers and/or expense limitations applicable to each class of shares of the Funds. If the performance of the privately offered funds had been restated to reflect the applicable fees and expenses of each share class of the Funds, the performance may have been higher or lower. The privately offered fund began operations on 31 May 2006, 22 December 2004 and 29 September 2005, for the PIMCO RAE Emerging Markets Fund, PIMCO RAE US Fund and PIMCO RAE US Small Fund, respectively, and on 5 June 2015, were reorganized into the Funds. Prior to the reorganization, the privately offered funds had an investment objective and investment strategies that were, in all material respects, the same as those of the Funds, and were managed in a manner that, in all material respects, complied with the investment guidelines and restrictions of the Funds. However, the privately offered funds were not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and were not subject to its requirements or requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which, if applicable, may have adversely affected their performance. The performance of each class of shares of the Funds will differ as a result of the different levels of fees and expenses applicable to each class of shares."																		
																		
																		
																		
"There is no assurance that any fund, including any fund that has experienced high or unusual performance for one or more periods, will experience similar levels of performance in the future. High performance is defined as a significant increase in either 1) a fund’s total return in excess of that of the fund’s benchmark between reporting periods or 2) a fund’s total return in excess of the fund’s historical returns between reporting periods. Unusual performance is defined as a significant change in a fund’s performance as compared to one or more previous reporting periods."																		
																		
																		
"Funds typically offer different share classes, which are subject to different fees and expenses (which may affect performance), having different minimum investment requirements and are entitled to different services."																		
																		
"A word about risk: All investments contain risk and may lose value. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations; bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise, and low interest rate environments increase this risk. Reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility. Bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic and industry conditions, the risk that fund shares could trade at prices other than the net asset value; and the risk that the manager's investment decisions might not produce the desired results. Investing in foreign-denominated and/or -domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets. High yield, lower-rated securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates, subject to early repayment risk, and their value may fluctuate in response to the market’s perception of issuer creditworthiness; while generally supported by some form of government or private guarantee, there is no assurance that private guarantors will meet their obligations. Derivatives and commodity-linked derivatives may involve certain costs and risks, such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Commodity-linked derivative instruments may involve additional costs and risks such as changes in commodity index volatility or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested. For risks associated with a particular Fund, please refer to the Fund's prospectus."																		
																		
"Distributions may be comprised of ordinary income, net capital gains, and/or a return of capital (“ROC”) of your investment in the Fund. If the Fund estimates that a portion of its distribution may be comprised of amounts from sources other than net investment income in accordance with its policies and good accounting practices, the Fund will notify shareholders of the estimated composition of such distribution through a Section 19 Notice. The amounts and composition of distributions reported on any Section 19 Notice issued by the Fund are only estimates and should not be used for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and composition of distributions for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during its entire fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Final determination of a distribution's tax character will be reported on Form 1099 DIV sent to shareholders for the calendar year."																		
																		
																		
The distribution yield for the PIMCO Funds monthly paying Funds is calculated by annualizing actual dividends distributed for the monthly period ended on the date shown and dividing by the net asset value on the last business day for the same period. The distribution yield for quarterly paying Funds is calculated by taking the average of the prior four quarterly distribution yields. The quarterly distribution yields are calculated by annualizing actual dividends distributed for the quarterly period ended on the most recent quarterly distribution date and dividing by the net asset value for the same date. The distribution yield for annual paying Funds is calculated by taking the annual distribution divided by the Fund’s net asset value on ex-date. The yield is annualized if the Fund incepted less than a year ago. The yield does not include long- or short-term capital gains distributions.

"Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of fees, such as brokerage commissions, and other fees to financial intermediaries.  In addition, an investor may incur costs attributed to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary market (the bid-ask spread).  Due to the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment returns. Investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who expect to engage in frequent trading. Exchange Traded Funds (“ETF”) are afforded certain exemptions from the Investment Company Act. The exemptions allow, among other things, for individual shares to trade on the secondary market. Individual shares cannot be directly purchased from or redeemed by the ETF. Purchases and redemptions directly with ETFs are only accomplished through creation unit aggregations or “baskets” of shares. Shares of an ETF, traded on the secondary market, are bought and sold at market price (not NAV). Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Investment policies, management fees and other information can be found in the individual ETF’s prospectus.  Net Asset Value (NAV) represents an ETF’s per-share value. The per-share value of an ETF is calculated by dividing the total value of the securities in its portfolio, less any liabilities, by the number of ETF shares outstanding. ETF shares are valued as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca (normally 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time) (The “NYSE Close”) on each business day.The Fund’s Net Asset Value, shares outstanding and total net assets are calculated as of the close of regular trading on each day that the NYSE Arca is open, and do not reflect security transactions or Fund shares created or redeemed on the date stated. Such transactions are recorded on the next business day and reported on the website the following business day. Returns are average annualized total returns, except for those periods of less than one year, which are cumulative. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 pm Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a percentage) between the NAV and the Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount or premium could be significant.  The daily premium/discount is the difference between the daily market price for shares of the Fund and the Fund's net asset value. For purposes of the premium/discount information, market price is determined using NYSE Arca’s Official Closing Price or if it more accurately reflects market price at the time as of which NAV is calculated, the midpoint between the national best bid and national best offer as of that time.  Market price for purposes of other information is calculated as follows: (i) for time periods preceding December 17, 2020, the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated and (ii) for the time periods starting December 17, 2020, the NYSE Arca’s Official Closing Price or, if it more accurately reflects market price at the time as of which NAV is calculated, the midpoint between the national best bid and national best offer as of that time. Market Price is the Official Closing Price on NYSE Arca, or if it more accurately reflects market value at the time as of which NAV is calculated, the midpoint between the national best bid and national best offer as of that time.  Median Bid/Ask spread is the difference between the bid price for a security and its ask price.  It is expressed as a percentage (rounded to the nearest hundredth) that is computed by identifying the fund’s national best bid and national best offer as of the end of each 10-second interval during each trading day for the last 30 calendar days, dividing the difference between each such bid and offer by the midpoint of the national best bid and national best offer, and identifying the median of those values. ETFs are subject to secondary market trading risks. Shares of an ETF will be listed for trading on an exchange, however, there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for such shares will develop or continue. There can be no guarantee that an ETF's exchange listing or ability to trade its shares will continue or remain unchanged. Shares of an ETF may trade on an exchange at prices at, above or below their most recent NAV. The per share NAV of an ETF is calculated at the end of each business day, and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading prices of an ETF's shares fluctuate continuously throughout the trading day based on market supply and demand, which may not correlate to NAV. The trading prices of an ETF's shares may differ significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility, which may, among other factors, lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV. Smart beta ETFS and index ETFs use an indexing approach and may be affected by a general decline in market segments or asset classes relating to its Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities and instruments included in, or representative of, its Underlying Index regardless of the investment merits of the Underlying Index.  Current holdings are subject to risk. Holdings are subject to change at any time. An investment in an ETF involves risk, including the loss of principal. Investment return, price, yield and Net Asset Value (NAV) will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed."																		
																		
The distribution yield for the PIMCO exchange-traded funds is calculated by annualizing actual dividends distributed for the monthly period ended on the most recent monthly distribution date and dividing by the net asset value for the same date. The yield does not include long- or short-term capital gains distributions. The Fund distributes substantially all of its net investment income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received from the Fund. 																		
																		
"Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. After the initial public offering, shares are sold on the open market through a stock exchange. As with any stock, the price of a closed-end fund’s common shares will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. The price received when shares are sold may be more or less than the original investment. Shares of closed-end funds may trade at a premium to their net asset value. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value. This risk may be greater for investors who sell their shares relatively shortly after the initial public offering. "																		
																		
																		
"Distribution rates for closed-end funds are not performance and are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution per share and dividing by the NAV or Market Price as of the reported date. Distributions may be comprised of ordinary income, net capital gains, and/or a return of capital (ROC) of your investment in the fund. Because the distribution rate may include a ROC, it should not be confused with yield or income. A negative value for Undistributed Net Investment Income represents the potential for a ROC on an estimated tax basis. Please refer to the most recent Section 19 Notice, if applicable, for additional information regarding the composition of distributions. Final determination of a distribution’s tax character will be made on Form 1099 DIV sent to shareholders each January."																		
																		
"Interval Funds are unlisted closed-end funds. Interval funds may be leveraged and carry various risks depending upon the underlying assets owned by a fund. Unlike typical closed-end funds an interval funds shares are not typically listed on a stock exchange. There is no secondary market for the fund’s shares and none is expected to develop. Historical performance may have been positively impacted by fee waivers or expense limitations in place during some or all of the periods shown, if applicable. Future performance (including total return or yield) and distributions may be negatively impacted by the expiration or reduction of any such fee waivers or expense limitations. An investment in an interval fund is not appropriate for all investors. Although interval funds provide limited liquidity to investors by offering to repurchase a limited amount of shares on a periodic basis, investors should consider shares of the Fund to be an illiquid investment. Investments in interval funds are therefore subject to liquidity risk as an investor may not be able to sell the shares at an advantageous time or price. There is no guarantee that an investor will be able to tender all of their requested Fund shares in a periodic repurchase offer. The fund’s distribution rate may be affected by numerous factors, including changes in realized and projected market returns, fund performance, and other factors. There can be no assurance that a change in market conditions or other factors will not result in a change in the fund distribution rate at a future time. Distribution rates are not performance. The distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution per share and dividing by the NAV as of the reported date. Distributions may be comprised of ordinary income, net capital gains, and/or a return of capital (ROC) of your investment in the fund. Because a distribution may include a ROC, the distribution rate should not be confused with yield or performance. Please refer to the most recent Section 19 Notice, if applicable, for additional information regarding the composition of distributions. It is important to note that differences exist between the fund’s daily internal accounting records, the fund’s financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and recordkeeping practices under income tax regulations. It is possible that the fund may not issue a Section 19 Notice in situations where the fund’s financial statements prepared later and in accordance with U.S. GAAP or the final tax character of those distributions might later report that the sources of those distributions included capital gains and/or a return of capital. Please see the fund’s most recent shareholder report for more details. Final determination of a distribution s tax character will be made on Form 1099 DIV sent to shareholders each January."

"Target Date Funds are designed to provide investors with a retirement solution tailored to the time when they expect to retire or plan to start withdrawing money (the ""target date""). Target Date Funds will gradually shift their emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on their target dates. Target Date Funds invest in other funds and instruments based on a long-term asset allocation glide path developed by PIMCO, and performance is subject to underlying investment weightings, which will change over time. An investment in a Target Date Fund does not eliminate the need for an investor to determine whether a Fund is appropriate for his or her financial situation. An investment in a Fund is not guaranteed. Investors may experience losses, including losses near, at, or after the target date, and there is no guarantee that a Fund will provide adequate income at and through retirement."

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or ""star rating"", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Past rankings are no guarantee of future rankings."
